# MVP Starter Kit

The Hotwire Android team has implemented the Model View Presenter (MVP) architecture for Android mobile applications. One of the challenges in writing enterprise Android apps is that they never stop growing, but that doesn't mean they have to be harder to maintain or add features to. Hotwire's MVP architecture was designed to add stability and organization to the development of enterprise Android applications. After implementing MVP in their own app, the Hotwire Android team built the MVP Starter Kit. The MVP Starter Kit includes a sample app built according to the MVP architecture and an MVP application template to help other developers in the Android community get a quick start building their own MVP applications.
